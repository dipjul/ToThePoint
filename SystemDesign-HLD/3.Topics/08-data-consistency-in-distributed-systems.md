# Data Consistency in Distributed Systems

## Overview

Data consistency in distributed systems is one of the most challenging aspects of system design. When data is replicated across multiple nodes, ensuring that all nodes have the same view of the data becomes complex, especially in the presence of network failures, concurrent updates, and varying performance requirements. This section explores consistency models, transaction isolation levels, and distributed consensus mechanisms.

## Data Consistency and Its Types

Data consistency refers to the requirement that all nodes in a distributed system have the same view of data at any given time. However, achieving perfect consistency often conflicts with availability and partition tolerance, leading to different consistency models.

### Strong Consistency

Strong consistency guarantees that all nodes see the same data at the same time. After a write operation completes, all subsequent reads will return the updated value.

#### Characteristics:
```
Write Operation:
Client → [Write] → Node 1 → [Sync] → Node 2, Node 3
Client ← [ACK after all nodes updated]

Read Operation:
Client → [Read] → Any Node → [Same data on all nodes]
```

#### Examples:
- **Traditional RDBMS**: PostgreSQL, MySQL with synchronous replication
- **Distributed Databases**: Google Spanner, CockroachDB
- **Consensus Systems**: Systems using Raft or Paxos

#### Advantages:
✅ **Predictable**: Application logic is simpler
✅ **ACID Properties**: Full transactional guarantees
✅ **No Conflicts**: No need to handle conflicting data
✅ **Immediate Consistency**: Reads always return latest data

#### Disadvantages:
❌ **Higher Latency**: Must wait for all nodes to acknowledge
❌ **Lower Availability**: System may become unavailable during network partitions
❌ **Scalability Limits**: Performance limited by slowest node
❌ **Network Dependency**: Requires reliable network connectivity

### Eventual Consistency

Eventual consistency guarantees that if no new updates are made to a data item, eventually all nodes will converge to the same value. However, there may be temporary inconsistencies.

#### Characteristics:
```
Write Operation:
Client → [Write] → Node 1 → [Immediate ACK]
                     ↓
              [Async Propagation] → Node 2, Node 3

Read Operation (during propagation):
Client → Node 1 → [Latest data]
Client → Node 2 → [Stale data] (temporarily)
```

#### Examples:
- **NoSQL Databases**: Cassandra, DynamoDB, CouchDB
- **DNS System**: Domain name propagation
- **CDN**: Content distribution networks
- **Social Media**: Facebook posts, Twitter feeds

#### Advantages:
✅ **High Availability**: System remains available during network issues
✅ **Better Performance**: Faster writes and reads
✅ **Scalability**: Can scale to many nodes
✅ **Partition Tolerance**: Continues operating during network splits

#### Disadvantages:
❌ **Temporary Inconsistency**: Nodes may have different data temporarily
❌ **Complex Application Logic**: Must handle conflicting data
❌ **Debugging Difficulty**: Harder to reason about system state
❌ **User Experience**: Users may see inconsistent data

### Weak Consistency

Weak consistency provides no guarantees about when all nodes will be consistent. The system will make a best effort to propagate updates, but there are no timing guarantees.

#### Characteristics:
- **No Guarantees**: No promise about when consistency will be achieved
- **Best Effort**: System tries to propagate updates when possible
- **Application Responsibility**: Applications must handle inconsistencies

#### Examples:
- **Real-time Systems**: Live video streaming, online gaming
- **Sensor Networks**: IoT data collection
- **Caching Systems**: Web caches, CDNs

### Consistency Spectrum

```
Strong Consistency
    ↑
Sequential Consistency (operations appear in some sequential order)
    ↑
Causal Consistency (causally related operations are ordered)
    ↑
Session Consistency (consistency within a session)
    ↑
Monotonic Read Consistency (reads don't go backwards)
    ↑
Monotonic Write Consistency (writes are ordered)
    ↑
Read Your Writes (see your own writes immediately)
    ↑
Eventual Consistency
    ↑
Weak Consistency
```

## Data Consistency Level Tradeoffs

Different consistency levels involve trade-offs between consistency, availability, and performance.

### CAP Theorem Revisited

The CAP theorem states that in a distributed system, you can only guarantee two of the following three properties:

#### Consistency (C)
- All nodes see the same data simultaneously
- Strong consistency guarantees

#### Availability (A)
- System remains operational
- Every request receives a response

#### Partition Tolerance (P)
- System continues to operate despite network failures
- Essential for distributed systems

### Consistency-Availability Trade-off

#### CP Systems (Consistency + Partition Tolerance)
```
During Network Partition:
- Maintain consistency
- Sacrifice availability
- Some nodes become unavailable

Examples: MongoDB, HBase, Redis Cluster
```

#### AP Systems (Availability + Partition Tolerance)
```
During Network Partition:
- Maintain availability
- Accept temporary inconsistency
- All nodes remain available

Examples: Cassandra, DynamoDB, CouchDB
```

### Tunable Consistency

Many modern distributed databases offer tunable consistency, allowing you to choose the appropriate level for each operation.

#### Cassandra Consistency Levels:

##### Read Consistency Levels:
- **ONE**: Read from one replica (fastest, least consistent)
- **QUORUM**: Read from majority of replicas
- **ALL**: Read from all replicas (slowest, most consistent)
- **LOCAL_QUORUM**: Read from majority in local datacenter

##### Write Consistency Levels:
- **ONE**: Write to one replica (fastest, least durable)
- **QUORUM**: Write to majority of replicas
- **ALL**: Write to all replicas (slowest, most durable)
- **LOCAL_QUORUM**: Write to majority in local datacenter

#### Example Configuration:
```python
# Strong consistency
session.execute(query, consistency_level=ConsistencyLevel.ALL)

# Eventual consistency
session.execute(query, consistency_level=ConsistencyLevel.ONE)

# Balanced approach
session.execute(query, consistency_level=ConsistencyLevel.QUORUM)
```

### Performance vs Consistency Matrix

| Consistency Level | Read Latency | Write Latency | Availability | Use Case |
|------------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|----------|
| **Strong** | High | High | Lower | Financial transactions |
| **Eventual** | Low | Low | Higher | Social media feeds |
| **Session** | Medium | Medium | Medium | User profiles |
| **Causal** | Medium | Medium | Medium | Collaborative editing |

## Quorum and Its Types

Quorum-based systems use voting mechanisms to ensure consistency and availability in distributed systems.

### Basic Quorum Concept

A quorum is the minimum number of nodes that must participate in an operation for it to be considered successful.

#### Quorum Formula:
```
For N replicas:
- Read Quorum (R): Minimum nodes for read operation
- Write Quorum (W): Minimum nodes for write operation
- Consistency Condition: R + W > N

Example with N = 5:
- W = 3, R = 3 (Strong consistency)
- W = 2, R = 4 (Read-optimized)
- W = 4, R = 2 (Write-optimized)
```

### Types of Quorums

#### 1. Simple Majority Quorum
```
N = 5 nodes
Quorum = (N/2) + 1 = 3 nodes

Benefits:
- Tolerates (N-1)/2 failures
- Prevents split-brain scenarios
- Simple to understand and implement
```

#### 2. Weighted Quorum
```
Node A: Weight = 3
Node B: Weight = 2  
Node C: Weight = 1
Total Weight = 6
Quorum = 4 (majority of total weight)

Use Cases:
- Nodes with different capabilities
- Geographic distribution considerations
- Cost optimization
```

#### 3. Hierarchical Quorum
```
Datacenter 1: 3 nodes (local quorum = 2)
Datacenter 2: 3 nodes (local quorum = 2)
Global quorum = 1 datacenter + 1 additional node

Benefits:
- Reduces cross-datacenter communication
- Better performance for local operations
- Maintains global consistency
```

### Quorum Implementation Example

```python
class QuorumSystem:
    def __init__(self, nodes, read_quorum, write_quorum):
        self.nodes = nodes
        self.read_quorum = read_quorum
        self.write_quorum = write_quorum
        
    def read(self, key):
        responses = []
        for node in self.nodes:
            try:
                response = node.read(key)
                responses.append(response)
                if len(responses) >= self.read_quorum:
                    break
            except NodeUnavailable:
                continue
                
        if len(responses) < self.read_quorum:
            raise InsufficientReplicas("Cannot achieve read quorum")
            
        # Return most recent version based on timestamp
        return max(responses, key=lambda r: r.timestamp)
        
    def write(self, key, value):
        successful_writes = 0
        for node in self.nodes:
            try:
                node.write(key, value)
                successful_writes += 1
                if successful_writes >= self.write_quorum:
                    return "Success"
            except NodeUnavailable:
                continue
                
        if successful_writes < self.write_quorum:
            raise InsufficientReplicas("Cannot achieve write quorum")
```

### Quorum Trade-offs

#### High Quorum (R=W=N):
```
Advantages:
✅ Strong consistency
✅ Always read latest data
✅ Simple conflict resolution

Disadvantages:
❌ Low availability (any node failure affects operations)
❌ High latency (must wait for all nodes)
❌ Poor partition tolerance
```

#### Low Quorum (R=W=1):
```
Advantages:
✅ High availability
✅ Low latency
✅ Good partition tolerance

Disadvantages:
❌ Weak consistency
❌ Possible stale reads
❌ Complex conflict resolution
```

#### Balanced Quorum (R+W>N, but R,W < N):
```
Advantages:
✅ Balance between consistency and availability
✅ Reasonable performance
✅ Fault tolerance

Disadvantages:
❌ More complex than extreme approaches
❌ Still possible temporary inconsistencies
❌ Requires careful tuning
```

## Transaction Levels

Transaction isolation levels define how transactions interact with each other and what anomalies are prevented.

### Read Uncommitted

The lowest isolation level where transactions can read uncommitted changes from other transactions.

#### Characteristics:
```
Transaction A: BEGIN → UPDATE balance = 100 → (not committed)
Transaction B: BEGIN → READ balance → sees 100 → COMMIT
Transaction A: ROLLBACK (balance reverts to original value)
```

#### Allowed Phenomena:
- **Dirty Reads**: Reading uncommitted data
- **Non-repeatable Reads**: Same query returns different results
- **Phantom Reads**: New rows appear in result set

#### Use Cases:
- **Reporting Systems**: Where approximate data is acceptable
- **Analytics**: Rough estimates and trends
- **Monitoring**: Real-time dashboards with approximate data

#### Implementation Considerations:
```sql
-- PostgreSQL
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;

-- MySQL
SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;
```

### Read Committed

Transactions can only read committed data, preventing dirty reads.

#### Characteristics:
```
Transaction A: BEGIN → UPDATE balance = 100 → (not committed)
Transaction B: BEGIN → READ balance → sees original value → COMMIT
Transaction A: COMMIT
Transaction B: BEGIN → READ balance → sees 100 → COMMIT
```

#### Prevented Phenomena:
- **Dirty Reads**: ✅ Prevented

#### Allowed Phenomena:
- **Non-repeatable Reads**: Same query may return different results
- **Phantom Reads**: New rows may appear

#### Implementation:
```python
# Most databases use read committed as default
class ReadCommittedTransaction:
    def read(self, key):
        # Only read committed versions
        return self.get_committed_version(key)
        
    def write(self, key, value):
        # Write to transaction-local buffer
        self.write_buffer[key] = value
        
    def commit(self):
        # Make all writes visible atomically
        for key, value in self.write_buffer.items():
            self.commit_version(key, value)
```

### Repeatable Reads

Ensures that if a transaction reads a value, subsequent reads within the same transaction will return the same value.

#### Characteristics:
```
Transaction A: BEGIN → READ balance (100) → ... → READ balance (100) → COMMIT
Transaction B: BEGIN → UPDATE balance = 200 → COMMIT
(Transaction A still sees 100 for all reads)
```

#### Prevented Phenomena:
- **Dirty Reads**: ✅ Prevented
- **Non-repeatable Reads**: ✅ Prevented

#### Allowed Phenomena:
- **Phantom Reads**: New rows may still appear

#### Implementation Approaches:

##### 1. Locking-based:
```python
class RepeatableReadTransaction:
    def __init__(self):
        self.read_locks = set()
        self.snapshot = {}
        
    def read(self, key):
        if key not in self.read_locks:
            self.acquire_shared_lock(key)
            self.read_locks.add(key)
            self.snapshot[key] = self.get_committed_version(key)
        return self.snapshot[key]
```

##### 2. Snapshot-based (MVCC):
```python
class MVCCTransaction:
    def __init__(self):
        self.start_timestamp = get_current_timestamp()
        
    def read(self, key):
        # Read version that was committed before transaction start
        return self.get_version_at_timestamp(key, self.start_timestamp)
```

### Serializable

The highest isolation level that ensures transactions execute as if they were run sequentially.

#### Characteristics:
```
All transactions appear to execute in some sequential order
No anomalies are possible
Equivalent to single-threaded execution
```

#### Prevented Phenomena:
- **Dirty Reads**: ✅ Prevented
- **Non-repeatable Reads**: ✅ Prevented
- **Phantom Reads**: ✅ Prevented
- **Serialization Anomalies**: ✅ Prevented

#### Implementation Approaches:

##### 1. Two-Phase Locking (2PL):
```python
class SerializableTransaction:
    def __init__(self):
        self.locks = set()
        self.phase = "GROWING"  # GROWING or SHRINKING
        
    def read(self, key):
        if self.phase == "SHRINKING":
            raise TransactionError("Cannot acquire locks in shrinking phase")
        self.acquire_shared_lock(key)
        self.locks.add(key)
        return self.get_value(key)
        
    def write(self, key, value):
        if self.phase == "SHRINKING":
            raise TransactionError("Cannot acquire locks in shrinking phase")
        self.acquire_exclusive_lock(key)
        self.locks.add(key)
        self.set_value(key, value)
        
    def commit(self):
        self.phase = "SHRINKING"
        # Release all locks
        for lock in self.locks:
            self.release_lock(lock)
```

##### 2. Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI):
```python
class SSITransaction:
    def __init__(self):
        self.start_timestamp = get_current_timestamp()
        self.read_set = set()
        self.write_set = set()
        
    def read(self, key):
        self.read_set.add(key)
        return self.get_snapshot_version(key, self.start_timestamp)
        
    def write(self, key, value):
        self.write_set.add(key)
        self.write_buffer[key] = value
        
    def commit(self):
        # Check for conflicts with concurrent transactions
        if self.has_rw_conflicts() or self.has_ww_conflicts():
            raise SerializationError("Transaction conflicts detected")
        self.apply_writes()
```

### Transaction Level Implementation

Different databases implement isolation levels differently:

#### PostgreSQL:
```sql
-- Uses MVCC for most isolation levels
BEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
-- Uses predicate locking for serializable
```

#### MySQL (InnoDB):
```sql
-- Uses locking and MVCC
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
-- Default level, prevents phantom reads using gap locks
```

#### Oracle:
```sql
-- Uses MVCC, only supports READ COMMITTED and SERIALIZABLE
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
```

## Two-Phase Commit (2PC)

Two-Phase Commit is a distributed transaction protocol that ensures all participants in a distributed transaction either commit or abort.

### 2PC Protocol

#### Phase 1: Prepare Phase
```
Coordinator → [PREPARE] → Participant 1
Coordinator → [PREPARE] → Participant 2
Coordinator → [PREPARE] → Participant 3

Participant 1 → [YES/NO] → Coordinator
Participant 2 → [YES/NO] → Coordinator  
Participant 3 → [YES/NO] → Coordinator
```

#### Phase 2: Commit/Abort Phase
```
If all participants voted YES:
Coordinator → [COMMIT] → All Participants

If any participant voted NO:
Coordinator → [ABORT] → All Participants
```

### 2PC Implementation

```python
class TwoPhaseCommitCoordinator:
    def __init__(self, participants):
        self.participants = participants
        self.transaction_id = generate_transaction_id()
        
    def execute_transaction(self, operations):
        try:
            # Phase 1: Prepare
            prepare_responses = []
            for participant in self.participants:
                response = participant.prepare(self.transaction_id, operations)
                prepare_responses.append(response)
                
            # Check if all participants are ready
            if all(response == "YES" for response in prepare_responses):
                # Phase 2: Commit
                for participant in self.participants:
                    participant.commit(self.transaction_id)
                return "COMMITTED"
            else:
                # Phase 2: Abort
                for participant in self.participants:
                    participant.abort(self.transaction_id)
                return "ABORTED"
                
        except Exception as e:
            # Abort on any error
            for participant in self.participants:
                participant.abort(self.transaction_id)
            return "ABORTED"

class TwoPhaseCommitParticipant:
    def __init__(self):
        self.prepared_transactions = {}
        
    def prepare(self, transaction_id, operations):
        try:
            # Validate operations and acquire locks
            self.validate_operations(operations)
            self.acquire_locks(operations)
            
            # Save transaction state
            self.prepared_transactions[transaction_id] = operations
            self.write_prepare_log(transaction_id, operations)
            
            return "YES"
        except Exception:
            return "NO"
            
    def commit(self, transaction_id):
        if transaction_id in self.prepared_transactions:
            operations = self.prepared_transactions[transaction_id]
            self.apply_operations(operations)
            self.write_commit_log(transaction_id)
            self.release_locks(operations)
            del self.prepared_transactions[transaction_id]
            
    def abort(self, transaction_id):
        if transaction_id in self.prepared_transactions:
            operations = self.prepared_transactions[transaction_id]
            self.release_locks(operations)
            self.write_abort_log(transaction_id)
            del self.prepared_transactions[transaction_id]
```

### 2PC Advantages

✅ **ACID Properties**: Guarantees atomicity across distributed systems
✅ **Consistency**: All participants have consistent view
✅ **Proven Protocol**: Well-understood and widely implemented
✅ **Strong Guarantees**: Either all participants commit or all abort

### 2PC Disadvantages

❌ **Blocking Protocol**: Participants block until coordinator responds
❌ **Single Point of Failure**: Coordinator failure can block system
❌ **Performance**: High latency due to multiple round trips
❌ **Scalability**: Performance degrades with more participants

### 2PC Failure Scenarios

#### Coordinator Failure:
```
Problem: Coordinator crashes after sending PREPARE
Solution: 
- Participants timeout and abort
- Use coordinator recovery with persistent logs
- Implement coordinator failover
```

#### Participant Failure:
```
Problem: Participant crashes during prepare phase
Solution:
- Coordinator aborts transaction
- Participant recovers using persistent logs
- Replay or abort based on log state
```

#### Network Partition:
```
Problem: Network splits coordinator from some participants
Solution:
- Use timeouts to detect failures
- Abort transaction on timeout
- Implement partition-tolerant consensus
```

## Three-Phase Commit (3PC)

Three-Phase Commit addresses some of the blocking issues in 2PC by adding an additional phase.

### 3PC Protocol

#### Phase 1: CanCommit
```
Coordinator → [CAN-COMMIT?] → Participants
Participants → [YES/NO] → Coordinator
```

#### Phase 2: PreCommit
```
If all YES:
Coordinator → [PRE-COMMIT] → Participants
Participants → [ACK] → Coordinator

If any NO:
Coordinator → [ABORT] → Participants
```

#### Phase 3: DoCommit
```
Coordinator → [DO-COMMIT] → Participants
Participants → [COMMIT] → Apply changes
```

### 3PC Advantages over 2PC

✅ **Non-blocking**: Participants can make progress during coordinator failure
✅ **Better Availability**: System can continue operating in some failure scenarios
✅ **Timeout Handling**: Clear timeout semantics for each phase

### 3PC Disadvantages

❌ **More Complex**: Additional phase increases complexity
❌ **Higher Latency**: More round trips than 2PC
❌ **Network Partition Issues**: Still has problems with network partitions
❌ **Rarely Used**: Most systems prefer other approaches

## Sagas

Sagas provide an alternative to distributed transactions by breaking long-running transactions into smaller, compensatable steps.

### Saga Pattern

Instead of a single distributed transaction, a saga is a sequence of local transactions, each with a corresponding compensation action.

#### Example: E-commerce Order Processing
```
Saga Steps:
1. Reserve Inventory → Compensate: Release Inventory
2. Process Payment → Compensate: Refund Payment  
3. Ship Order → Compensate: Cancel Shipment
4. Update Loyalty Points → Compensate: Deduct Points
```

### Types of Sagas

#### 1. Choreography-based Saga
```
Each service knows what to do next and publishes events

Order Service → [OrderCreated] → Event Bus
                                     ↓
Payment Service ← [OrderCreated] ← Event Bus
Payment Service → [PaymentProcessed] → Event Bus
                                          ↓
Inventory Service ← [PaymentProcessed] ← Event Bus
```

#### 2. Orchestration-based Saga
```
Central orchestrator coordinates the saga

Saga Orchestrator → [Reserve Inventory] → Inventory Service
Saga Orchestrator ← [Inventory Reserved] ← Inventory Service
Saga Orchestrator → [Process Payment] → Payment Service
Saga Orchestrator ← [Payment Processed] ← Payment Service
```

### Saga Implementation

#### Choreography Example:
```python
class OrderService:
    def create_order(self, order_data):
        # Create order locally
        order = self.save_order(order_data)
        
        # Publish event for next step
        event_bus.publish("OrderCreated", {
            "order_id": order.id,
            "customer_id": order.customer_id,
            "items": order.items
        })
        
    def handle_payment_failed(self, event):
        # Compensate: Cancel order
        order_id = event["order_id"]
        self.cancel_order(order_id)

class PaymentService:
    def handle_order_created(self, event):
        try:
            # Process payment
            payment = self.process_payment(event["customer_id"], event["amount"])
            
            # Publish success event
            event_bus.publish("PaymentProcessed", {
                "order_id": event["order_id"],
                "payment_id": payment.id
            })
        except PaymentError:
            # Publish failure event
            event_bus.publish("PaymentFailed", {
                "order_id": event["order_id"],
                "reason": "Insufficient funds"
            })
```

#### Orchestration Example:
```python
class OrderSagaOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.saga_state = {}
        
    def start_order_saga(self, order_data):
        saga_id = generate_saga_id()
        self.saga_state[saga_id] = {
            "step": 1,
            "order_data": order_data,
            "completed_steps": []
        }
        
        self.execute_step(saga_id, 1)
        
    def execute_step(self, saga_id, step):

### Saga Advantages

✅ **No Distributed Locks**: Each step is a local transaction
✅ **Better Performance**: No blocking on distributed coordination
✅ **Scalability**: Can handle long-running processes
✅ **Flexibility**: Can implement complex business logic

### Saga Disadvantages

❌ **Eventual Consistency**: No immediate consistency guarantees
❌ **Complexity**: More complex error handling and compensation
❌ **Partial Failures**: System may be in intermediate states
❌ **Debugging**: Harder to debug distributed saga execution

### When to Use Sagas

**Use Sagas When:**
- Long-running business processes
- Cross-service transactions
- High availability requirements
- Eventual consistency is acceptable

**Avoid Sagas When:**
- Strong consistency required
- Simple, short transactions
- Single service operations
- ACID properties are critical

## Conclusion

Data consistency in distributed systems involves complex trade-offs between consistency, availability, and performance. Key takeaways:

1. **Choose Appropriate Consistency Level**: Based on business requirements
2. **Understand Trade-offs**: Consistency vs availability vs performance
3. **Use Quorums Wisely**: Balance between consistency and availability
4. **Select Right Transaction Model**: 2PC for strong consistency, Sagas for flexibility
5. **Plan for Failures**: Design systems that handle network partitions and node failures

The key is to understand your specific requirements and choose the consistency model that best fits your use case, rather than trying to achieve the strongest consistency everywhere.
