# Introduction to High Level Design

## Overview

High Level Design (HLD) is the architectural blueprint that defines how a software system will be structured at a macro level. It's the bridge between business requirements and technical implementation, focusing on the overall system architecture, major components, and their interactions without diving into low-level implementation details.

## What is High Level Design?

High Level Design is a system design approach that:

- **Defines System Architecture**: Shows how different components interact
- **Identifies Major Components**: Breaks down the system into manageable parts
- **Establishes Data Flow**: Shows how information moves through the system
- **Plans for Scale**: Considers how the system will handle growth
- **Addresses Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, security, reliability

### Key Characteristics:

1. **Abstract View**: Focuses on "what" rather than "how"
2. **Component-Based**: Identifies major building blocks
3. **Technology Agnostic**: Doesn't specify exact technologies initially
4. **Scalability Focused**: Plans for future growth
5. **Business Aligned**: Maps to business requirements

## Importance of Designing Scalable, Reliable, and Maintainable Systems

### Why These Three Pillars Matter:

#### 1. Scalability
- **Definition**: System's ability to handle increased load
- **Business Impact**: Supports business growth without complete redesign
- **Technical Benefits**: Efficient resource utilization, cost optimization
- **User Experience**: Consistent performance as user base grows

#### 2. Reliability
- **Definition**: System's ability to function correctly under various conditions
- **Business Impact**: Maintains user trust, prevents revenue loss
- **Technical Benefits**: Predictable system behavior, easier debugging
- **User Experience**: Consistent availability and functionality

#### 3. Maintainability
- **Definition**: Ease of modifying, updating, and extending the system
- **Business Impact**: Faster feature delivery, reduced development costs
- **Technical Benefits**: Cleaner code, easier debugging, better team productivity
- **User Experience**: Regular improvements and bug fixes

### The Cost of Poor Design:

```
Poor HLD → Technical Debt → Slower Development → Higher Costs → Poor User Experience
```

## How to Approach High Level System Design

### The Systematic Approach:

#### Phase 1: Requirements Gathering (10-15 minutes)

**Functional Requirements:**
- What should the system do?
- What are the core features?
- What are the user workflows?

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- How many users?
- What's the expected load?
- What are the performance requirements?
- What are the availability requirements?

**Constraints:**
- Budget limitations
- Technology constraints
- Time constraints
- Compliance requirements

#### Phase 2: Capacity Estimation (5-10 minutes)

**Key Metrics to Calculate:**
```
- Daily Active Users (DAU)
- Requests Per Second (RPS)
- Storage Requirements
- Bandwidth Requirements
- Memory Requirements
```

**Example Calculation:**
```
DAU: 1M users
Average requests per user: 100/day
Total daily requests: 100M
RPS = 100M / 86400 = ~1,157 RPS
Peak RPS (3x average) = ~3,471 RPS
```

#### Phase 3: High-Level Architecture Design (20-25 minutes)

**Start Simple:**
```
[Client] → [Load Balancer] → [Application Server] → [Database]
```

**Add Complexity Gradually:**
- Caching layers
- Message queues
- Microservices
- CDN
- Search engines

#### Phase 4: Deep Dive (15-20 minutes)

**For Each Component:**
- Purpose and functionality
- Technology choices
- Scaling strategies
- Failure handling
- Performance considerations

#### Phase 5: Scale and Optimize (10-15 minutes)

**Address:**
- Bottlenecks identification
- Scaling strategies
- Performance optimization
- Reliability improvements
- Cost optimization

## HLD Interview Tips

### Before the Interview:

#### Preparation Checklist:
✅ **Study Common Patterns**: Load balancing, caching, sharding
✅ **Practice Calculations**: QPS, storage, bandwidth estimations
✅ **Know Trade-offs**: CAP theorem, consistency vs availability
✅ **Understand Technologies**: When to use SQL vs NoSQL, Redis vs Memcached
✅ **Practice Drawing**: System diagrams, data flow diagrams

#### Common System Design Questions:
- Design a URL shortener (like bit.ly)
- Design a social media feed
- Design a chat system
- Design a video streaming service
- Design a ride-sharing service

### During the Interview:

#### The RADIO Method:
1. **R**equirements - Clarify functional and non-functional requirements
2. **A**rchitecture - Design high-level architecture
3. **D**ata Model - Design data storage and retrieval
4. **I**nterface - Define APIs and user interfaces
5. **O**ptimize - Scale and optimize the design

#### Best Practices:

**Do's:**
✅ Ask clarifying questions
✅ Start simple, then add complexity
✅ Explain your thought process
✅ Consider trade-offs
✅ Think about edge cases
✅ Be prepared to defend your choices

**Don'ts:**
❌ Jump to implementation details
❌ Ignore scalability requirements
❌ Forget about failure scenarios
❌ Over-engineer from the start
❌ Ignore the interviewer's feedback

### Communication Tips:

#### Effective Communication:
1. **Think Out Loud**: Share your reasoning process
2. **Use Diagrams**: Visual representations are powerful
3. **Ask for Feedback**: "Does this approach make sense?"
4. **Admit Uncertainties**: "I'm not sure about X, but here's my thinking..."
5. **Stay Organized**: Follow a structured approach

#### Common Mistakes to Avoid:
- Not asking enough questions
- Focusing too much on one component
- Ignoring non-functional requirements
- Not considering failure scenarios
- Being too rigid with initial design

## Key Design Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- Each component has a single responsibility
- Reduces complexity and improves maintainability
- Enables independent scaling and development

### 2. Loose Coupling
- Components interact through well-defined interfaces
- Changes in one component don't affect others
- Enables independent deployment and scaling

### 3. High Cohesion
- Related functionality is grouped together
- Improves code organization and maintainability
- Reduces communication overhead

### 4. Fail-Safe Design
- System continues to operate even when components fail
- Graceful degradation instead of complete failure
- Includes redundancy and backup mechanisms

### 5. Design for Scale
- Consider future growth from the beginning
- Plan for horizontal and vertical scaling
- Optimize for performance and cost

## Common Architecture Patterns

### 1. Layered Architecture
```

└─────────┘  └─────────┘  └─────────┘
```

### 3. Event-Driven Architecture

## Conclusion

High Level Design is the foundation of successful software systems. It requires balancing multiple concerns - functionality, scalability, reliability, maintainability, and cost. The key is to:

1. **Start with clear requirements**
2. **Design incrementally**
3. **Consider trade-offs carefully**
4. **Plan for failure and scale**
5. **Communicate effectively**

Remember: There's no single "correct" design. The best design depends on your specific requirements, constraints, and context. Focus on demonstrating your thought process and ability to make informed trade-offs.
