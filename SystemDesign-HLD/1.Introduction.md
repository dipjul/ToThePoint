# Introduction

A System Design Interview usually lasts for 45-60 minutes.

The following template will guide you on how to manage time duration across various aspects of it -

## ✅ 𝐑𝐞𝐪𝐮𝐢𝐫𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐂𝐥𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 - (3-5 𝐦𝐢𝐧)

Ask clarifying questions to understand the problem and expectations of the interviewer.
- 𝐅𝐮𝐧𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐑𝐞𝐪𝐮𝐢𝐫𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬
  -  Focussed use cases to cover (MVP)
  -  Use cases that will not be covered
  -  Who will use the system
  -  Total/Daily active users
  -  How the system will be used
- 𝐍𝐨𝐧 𝐅𝐮𝐧𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐑𝐞𝐪𝐮𝐢𝐫𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬
  -  Is the system Highly Available or Highly Consistent? CAP theorem?
  -  Does the system requires low latency?
  -  Does the system needs to be reliable?

## ✅ 𝐄𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 (3-5 𝐦𝐢𝐧)
  -  Latency/Throughput expectations
  -  QPS (Queries Per Second) Read/Write ratio
  -  Traffic estimates
  -  Storage estimates
  -  Memory estimates

## ✅ 𝐀𝐏𝐈 𝐃𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧 (3-5 𝐦𝐢𝐧)
